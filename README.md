# shoppingcart
A simple app to learn Go programming during the DevOps class


After setting up your Go environment, please clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:midoblgsm/shoppingcart.git
cd shoppingcart
```

Now you have the code locally and you can checkout the first week initial content:
```
git checkout tags/week1initial
```

Open the code in your favorite editor and you are ready to start coding. To test that everything is right, you can run the main function:
```
# go run main.go
=>Not implemented
```

It is time to implement your methods.
